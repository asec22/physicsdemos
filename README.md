# Physics Demonstrations Suite
## About
Physics Demonstration Suite is a group of physics demonstrations using the Flask architecture and maplotlib.animations to bring to physics concepts.  An explanation and follow up questions are provided with each maplotlib.animation.  Updates will be provided as more demonstrations are created.
## Run Locally 
To run the suite locally, make sure you have the latest Python distribution installed on your computer.  In an empty director, follow these steps:
+ Run `git clone https://github.com/asec22/physicsdemos.git`.
+ Run `python -m venv ./venv` to create virtual environemnt.
+ Run `./venv/scripts/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
+ Run `python demo.py` to start the server and application.
+ Open and browser and open [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
## Running the Suite
The suite will open to a list of demonstrations avaialable.  Click on the one you want to explore. Enter the variables and click `Submit`.  The demonstration will render, use the buttons on the bottom of the demonstration to see the action of the object in the physics demonstration.  Below the demonstration, an explanation of the motion of the objects and some questions for thought are included.
